# SPRINT2
Jpaint is application looks like  MS paint . This is  sprint 2 for subject SE 450 Object Oriented Software development. 
Professor name:- Jeffrey Sharpe. 
The project is based on  development with the aim of utilizing skills acquired during class into a small application with the help of concepts and lecture provided. 

Assignment 2 can implemented by below mentioned features. 
I added Three different mode for the selected buttons (1.Draw, 2.Select, 3. Move)
The Three different shapes can be selected (1. Elipse , 2. Rectangle, 3. Triangle)
I also provided the option for User to change Primary and Secondary color by mouse click method.
I also provided Three Shedding types which can do this fetures-( OUTLINE, FILLED_IN, OUTLINE_AND_FILLED_IN).


In the Draw mode Shape we can make by click and drop the shapes (Rectangle, Elipse ,Triangle). As per instruction the size of the shape will be exactly the same as per the mouse movement.
The colours (primary and secondary) is use for out line and shape colour . primary is use for selecting shape colour and secondary is use for outline.
While draw mode is selected Shape(Rectangle, Elipse ,Triangle)  will only displayed on screen just after mouse released. Shape will be displayed as per shedding mode selected by user.
While Select mode is selected one or multiple shape can be selected.
While Move mode, selected object can be moved from one location to another location 
Undo/REdo feature (implemented in 1st sprint).
